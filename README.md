# LomoSnaps

LomoSnaps is a cross platform mobile app that makes sharing event photos easy and fun. Inspired by the disposable cameras of yesteryear, users can set up events and invite friends, the events attendees are then able to take a limited number of photos (the amount decided by the event organiser) and the photos are sent straight to the cloud. Upon the event end date, everyone's photos are then automatically sent back to the devices for viewing.

## Getting Started

To get all the code for this project on your local machine, first clone this repo and then cd into the project file. run the command ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies.

The app was created using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and so the easiest way to get it running on you mobile device is to download the [Expo App](https://expo.io/) from either the Play Store or App Store. You can now run ```npm start``` in your terminal. This will open Expo Developer Tools in the browser and you can now use the Expo app on your mobile device to access LomoSnaps through the network tunnel Expo sets up, provided both devices are connected to the same network.
